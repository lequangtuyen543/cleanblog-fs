But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.\n\nWhat was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.\n\nA Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.\n\nFor those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us."
